# Sample Metals project for sbt

To start the repository in Gitpod just use the below link:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/scalameta/gitpod-sample/tree/minimal-setup

It will start a new project with Metals already installed.

Bloop console will be available in the terminal itself.

Possible improvements to Metals:
- do not show build import if the bloop files exist
